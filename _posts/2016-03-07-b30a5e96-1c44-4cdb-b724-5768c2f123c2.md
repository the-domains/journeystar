**Focusing on a Journeystar**

**During my first flying lesson above the cornfields of Iowa, a stunt pilot known as ****Upside-Down Henry told me to "focus on the place to land, not on the place you could ****crash."**

**He was right. Focus on what you want, not on what you don't want.**

**Our focus is our reality; it gives us direction. If you become lost, confused or disoriented, ****focus on immediate solutions and strategies. Take one step at a time.**

**In your daily life, focus your time and energy on doing the things you are truly brilliant ****at. Create a powerful personal compass for finding your way in life by triangulating ****your purpose, your passion and your proof so they converge on a single point of ****focus---a journeystar.**
